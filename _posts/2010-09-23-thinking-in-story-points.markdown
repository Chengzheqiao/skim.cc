In an effort to prevent missed iteration deadlines, I'm now thinking about points everyday.  How many points do I have left on the board?  How many points left in the week?  Am I ahead or am I falling behind?  Each craftsman and apprentice are to complete 2 points per day and are assigned 10 points worth of stories in a given week.  Of course, my inexperience at estimating stories burdens me as I mostly underestimate stories.  There are other times though where my estimate was pretty close, but unnecessary yak shaving ensued.  Some stories weren't meant to be difficult, but I placed them in that category and read too much about the story topic before actually spiking out the solution.  I'm hoping with enough experience and time, I will be better at estimating stories.

With that in mind, I continued working on my stories, today with the [Bowling kata in Java](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata) story.  Fortunately, Uncle Bob wrote a powerpoint presentation which walks you through the kata.  This kata is a lot longer than the Prime Factors kata and therefore slightly more difficult.  I clocked in at 15 minutes to complete the kata.  At the end of the day, I picked music, and recorded the kata using Snapz Pro X and [uploaded it on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/15239027).  I made some typing mistakes here and there, but nothing to cry about.  I'm pretty happy with it.  I think I'll record the Prime Factors kata as well in the near future.

My next story is to write a jar file to will convert a Limelight styles.rb into a Java equivalent.  I don't even know where to begin, so I'm going to ask Micah a lot of questions.  Hopefully, he'll have time to pair and I can get an understanding of what the Java equivalent looks like, so I know where I need to go in terms of the code.

Tomorrow is going to be a busy day, with a new apprentice and a continuation of the 8LU session with Doug on DSP (digital signal processing).
