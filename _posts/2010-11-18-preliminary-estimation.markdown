For the early part of the day yesterday, I sat down with another 8th Lighter to go over the potential client's list of actionable items that need to be completed at a certain time (it sounds vague I know, but it's intentional).  We went over each item on the list discussing what the item means and what work is involved to implement the item into the application.  We used the PERT model to calculate each item based on the points we gave in the following categories: optimistic, realistic, pessimistic.  I've used the PERT model [before](http://skim.cc/2010/09/14/rails-3-and-new-iteration/) and it worked out much better with estimates.  In addition, I leaned on the other 8th Lighter as he has more experience in Rails than I do.  I look forward to what the client has to say.

Colin and I worked on some more tickets after lunch as we learned more about the application.  I've noticed in addition to the Rails DSL, this particular application has DSL of its own that I have not quite grasped.  Not having a local copy of the source makes it even harder.  Unfortunately (for me at least), the security checks are more troubling than what it's worth, but it would have been beneficial to learn more the application.

Today, we'll be working again at the client's office.  I've always been wanting to go to the [Chicago Geek breakfast](http://chicago-geek-breakfast.gathers.us/events) and finally found an opportunity, so I took an earlier train to nerd out while having breakfast.  It's going to be a fun day in Chicago.
