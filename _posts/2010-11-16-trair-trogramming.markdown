*Note:* I thought I'd name this post the exact same as my apprentice mate, Steven's [post]( http://journal.degutis.org/entries/2010/11/16/trair-trogramming) because we have nearly identical names, we both "pair" programmed with Colin, and we played a game of Go.  These events all occurred today.  It wouldn't make sense to name it otherwise.

So today, Colin, Steven, and I paired to tackle some support tickets for the client.  I noticed this was a great way to learn more about the Rails application \- by working on tickets and researching the problem in different areas of the application.  I've read somewhere that tri\-pair programming can actually lessen the experience, but it was not the case with our session.  As Steven mentioned in his post, I believe he and I helped Colin.  I did ask a lot of questions that probably slowed the process down, but Colin was very patient and answered all of my questions.  It helped me understand the application more and the root of the problem we were solving.  

### Meeting with another client

I briefly left Colin and Steven to attend a meeting with other 8th Lighters and a potential client.  We went through the details of what the client wanted and we are to come back with estimates.  Fortunately, the client gave us the source code, so it will give me a better idea how to estimate each actionable item.
