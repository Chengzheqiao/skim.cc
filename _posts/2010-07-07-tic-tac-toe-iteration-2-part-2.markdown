I had fun pairing today with swapped craftsman, [Rob Sanheim](http://twitter.com/rsanheim) who is here for the week.  He showed me a ton of cool tricks:

* tracking git repos
* git log
* git commit --amend
* specing a method that creates a new Thread instance
* creating a class method in Player class to create instance of all player types
* creating a Rakefile to run specs
* a great windowing utility called [SizeUp](http://irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)

I also learned that my [Mac environment](http://skim.cc/2010/06/20/mac-environment) could use a bit more tweaking;  I noticed my environment slowed him down in many areas and he went about fixing some of them to improve the productivity flow.  Kudos!  I will spend some time in the near future improving my environment.

I talked to Micah to catch him up on what I was doing.  Micah (customer) and I are planning to meet tomorrow to discuss Iteration #1 stories.  I hope he will be satisfied with what I did so far to the eye-candy enhancements.

Later this evening, I merged my refactoring branch back to master, so you can see the latest changes [here](http://github.com/sl4m/tic_tac_toe_ruby).  I look forward to making more changes to my Tic Tac Toe project.
