I spent [all day](http://skim.la/2010/07/15/first-look-at-mongodb) today looking at the MongoDB [documentation](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ruby+Language+Center), playing around with the commands in [Try MongoDB](http://try.mongodb.org/) and irb sessions.  I [said](http://skim.cc/2010/07/14/end-of-iteration-2) I was going to try [MongoDB Koans](http://github.com/chicagoruby/MongoDB_Koans), but thought the documentation was good enough to get started.  You can read about the MongoDB experience on my other [blog](http://skim.la/2010/07/15/first-look-at-mongodb).  I have a clear head for what I want to do to write all of the possible moves for the 4x4 board.  I'm going to try without create an index to see if there's a dramatic performance increase when indexing.  I also plan to write the moves to the database and export the Mongo collection as a \*.bson file which you can easily do with the *mongodump --db db_name --collection coll_name* command.  This command can be run even if the database is running and active.  Then, I'll somehow use *mongorestore* to restore the collection.

I'm headed to Ruby Midwest early tomorrow morning.  I will blog about the talks and hackery.
