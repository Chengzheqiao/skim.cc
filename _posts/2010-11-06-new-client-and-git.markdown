## New Client

I worked with Paul yesterday to integrate a pdf generator in a Rails project.  The code that generates the pdfs is written in Java and called within Rails via JRuby.  On the Java side, we implemented the template pattern to make the code as DRY as possible.  Paul gave me access to the GitHub repo and access to the staging server.  I plan to fiddle around with it over the weekend and pick up Rails again to familiarize myself with the dsl.

## Lunch 'n' Learn - Git Session

Craig presented his final session on Git, talking in detail about branching, merging, rebasing, and tagging.  It was nice to see in detail why some merges are fast forwards, recursive, and conflicted.  I've been merging lately, but will start rebasing for future commits.

## Vim

Ever since I saw Eric Smith's vim skills, I decided to pick up new vim commands and even install vimium and vimperator on Chrome and Firefox respectively.  These extensions allow you to use vim (like) commands on the browser without having to use the mouse.
