Today, Colin and I took the train down to Chicago to go to the client's office to meet up with Justin where we partook in a meeting about email subscriptions.  I sat in to get the gist of the goals the client has in place for the service they offer.  It was a pretty interesting conversation.  Usually, I'm the end\-user where subscription\-based email is important to me.  I want to be able to unsubscribe at any time without the need to log in.  The meeting was partly to take priority of the issue and make sure it's easy for the customers to unsubscribe and comply with the CAN\-SPAM Act.  Colin and I briefly pairing in the morning and later in the day, I ended up pairing with Justin to implement a Rails view which makes it easier to navigate than the original view in place.  There was quite a few yak shaving Rails DSL we had to weed through.  I'm still somewhat weak in understanding Rails routing, as well as views, so I'm not sure if I was of much help.  It was fun pairing though and trying to understand the context of the problems both Colin and Justin were solving.  Throughout the week, I plan to pick up Rails again and learn more about its magic.

I'll be meeting with a couple of 8th Lighters tomorrow for a potential client which is exciting in it of itself.  I look forward to the meeting and seeing what's in store for this opportunity.
