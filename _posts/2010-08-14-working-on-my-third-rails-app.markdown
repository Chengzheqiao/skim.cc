Yesterday was a steady day at the office.  Our Lunch 'n Learn was postponed to next week since most of the craftsmen are out at Agile 2010.  I re-read parts of the Principles and Patterns and re-watched parts of Jim Weirich's talk so I could [write](http://skim.cc/2010/08/13/principles-and-patterns-part-2) about it.

As the post title indicates, I will be working on my third Rails app.  I'm pretty excited as this takes on a slightly bigger task.  I'm teaming up with Matt Hinger and will be implementing the piece of functionality that I wrote for the second Rails app.  There will be some new things I need to learn how to do.  One is using Cucumber for acceptance tests, other is login authentication.  I'm not sure what else is in store, so I'll need to study the Rails project for that.  I'm really excited to be working on client projects.  This should be a great experience with Rails and the Agile process.

## End of Iteration 6

I had a chance to talk to Micah while he was at Agile.  During the meeting, I expressed my concerns about the meta tag hack I implemented and he welcomed me to the world of web development.  I then realized my concern was legitimate.  This was not an easy thing to do on the web where you're having to deal with GET/POST requests vs. a GUI event loop where it's a bit more flexible and forgiving.  I discovered some issues with the meta tag hack and will need to fix the issues for the next iteration.  So I was not able to complete all ten points, but most of them were completed and moved over to the archive.  Since I will be working on the third Rails app, my focus next week will be on that project.  I will be fixing the meta tag issues this weekend.
