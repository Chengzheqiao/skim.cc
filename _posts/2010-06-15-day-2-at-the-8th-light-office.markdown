Over the weekend I threw the source and tests on [GitHub](http://github.com/sl4m/tic_tac_toe_ruby).  Yesterday I worked on my Tic Tac Toe program again placing the source files in the lib folder and tests in the spec folder.  I brought my hard copy of [The Well Grounded Rubyist](http://www.amazon.com/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1276612135&sr=8-1) with me and read a bit on Procs and lambdas to extract one of my methods, but later found out that I may be misusing it - there should be a different way to solve the problem.  

There are couple of things I want to add to my Tic Tac Toe program.  First being the MinMax algorithm that I'm still trying to wrap my head around.  I think this [article](http://ai-depot.com/articles/minimax-explained/) best explains it.  The second part is extracting the UI code and creating a new class.

In the evening, I listened to all of the podcasts on [Software Craftsmanship Podcast](http://softwarecraftsmanship.libsyn.com/) hosted by one of our software craftsman, [Paul Pagel](http://twitter.com/paulwpagel).  There's a lot of good information about software craftsmanship and should probably be a great introduction to the movement.  I'm particularly excited to learn more about software craftsmanship and look forward to the [Software Craftsmanship North America](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) conference this year.
