This Friday, I will be attending the [SCNA (Software Craftsmanship North America) Conference](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) with other 8th Lighters and software craftsmen from all over the world.  I look forward to the [talks](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/schedule) (love the fact that it's single track) and look forward to the fun activities like the [SCNA 5k](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/scna-5k), Chicago Dine Around event, SCNA after party, and code retreat with Corey Haines.  [Tickets](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) are still available, so I highly recommend checking it out!  This will be my first SCNA attendance.  I look forward to meeting other craftsmen.
