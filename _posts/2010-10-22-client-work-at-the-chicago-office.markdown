## Client Work

Today, I went down to the Chicago office to work with Doug and Li-Hsuan.  It looks like I'll be working with them for about a week or so.  We had a quick stand-up meeting where I was introduced to the client.  Li-Hsuan and I were assigned a couple of stories while Doug worked on a different story.  Right off the bat, we had a bit of trouble configuring IntelliJ, but were able to resolve them.  We started by creating tests and do some refactoring.  I tried to mimic what the Bobs did in the bowling session.  I really wanted the tests (and code) to be readable and clear.  I think in the end, we ended up with tests that read nicely.  We also started applying the Strategy pattern for a particular story we were working on.  This was a pattern I recently learned about!  It was so exciting to be applying the knowledge I've learned this week.  I look forward to working more on the story tomorrow.  

## Clojure Koans

During lunch, the 8th Light "city" office likes to have hands-on Lunch n' Learn sessions (everyday?).  This week they're doing Clojure Koans.  It was fun going through the koans again.  We would each take turns completing a koan in a counter\-clockwise fashion.  Fortunatley I did not forget Clojure's syntax and worked my through them all until lunch was over.

*Note:* I apologize for the short post.  I will have more material when I read more from the PPP book and Design Patterns book.
