I worked on the minmax algorithm all day today, but unfortunately it's still not complete.  The logic seems to be there except the values of the moves are coming up incorrect.  Li-Hsuan has been very helpful, coming by every so often to check up on me to see how I'm doing.  He's definitely given me hints on how to tackle the problem.

This is due tomorrow, so I apologize for the short post.
