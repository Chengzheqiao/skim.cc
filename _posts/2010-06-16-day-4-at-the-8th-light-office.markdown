Last night and a part of today, I worked on extracting the UI code of the Tic Tac Toe program.  I'm pretty sure you're tired of hearing about the Tic Tac Toe program, I apologize.  I should have it done by the end of this week.

I was still stumped on the MinMax algorithm, but with the help of Micah and Li-Hsuan, I started on my MinMax method.  The latest code can be accessed via my GitHub [repo](http://github.com/sl4m/tic_tac_toe_ruby).

Aside from my mini project, I have to say, I'm really enjoying our community lunches.  At my two previous jobs, I usually ate at my desk, but at 8th Light, we all eat at the same time.  8th Lighters who brought their food will wait for the ones who went out to buy lunch.  Then at the community table, we talk about all sorts of topics.  I think it's a great way to get to know more about each other on a personal level.  I think it's a brilliant idea.

I truly enjoy being an apprentice at 8th Light and I'm excited about the journey ahead.  Ok back to my MinMax algorithm...
