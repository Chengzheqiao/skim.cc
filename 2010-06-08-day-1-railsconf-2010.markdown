My first day as an apprentice probably does not traditionally follow the first day of [other](http://softwareapprenticeship.wordpress.com/), [former](http://8thlightapprenticeship.blogspot.com/) 8th Light apprentices.  I'm at RailsConf and my minmax algorithm task is due next Monday.  While I'm excited to be here, I'm finding it difficult to focus on my task.  [Jim Suchy](http://twitter.com/jsuchy) gave me a good advice on how to start my algorithm - start coding, get it working, then erase it and write tests for it.  This is how I'll start.
